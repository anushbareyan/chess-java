# Chess Game Project

This repository contains a Java-based Chess Game project that implements the fundamental mechanics of a chess game, including representing the chessboard, moves, various chess pieces, gameplay logic, console-based interactions, and a graphical user interface (GUI).

## Overview

This project was developed as part of an assignment of OOP course to create a comprehensive chess game using Java programming. The objective was to demonstrate proficiency in object-oriented programming principles, game logic implementation, and user interface development.

## Features

- **Chessboard Representation**: Implemented a two-dimensional array to represent the chessboard and populated it with various chess pieces.
- **Piece Movements**: Developed logic for individual piece movements based on their respective rules and interactions.
- **Console Interface**: Designed a console-based interface allowing users to play the game via text inputs.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Created a graphical interface enabling users to interact with the game using a visual chessboard.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized into different packages:

- `j.game.chess`: Main package containing ChessConsole, Position, Move, Chess, Knight, Rook, Bishop, Queen, Pawn, King classes.
- `j.game.chess.cli`: Contains the ChessConsole class for console-based interactions.
- `j.game.chess.core`: Contains core classes like Position, Move, Chess, Knight, Rook, Bishop, Queen, Pawn, King.
- `j.game.chess.puzzles`: Contains classes related to puzzles and PuzzleDatabase.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The project is entirely developed in Java, leveraging its object-oriented features and libraries.
